# project
 this is the basic structure in vue js 3 (header, navbar,and footer)
 
 #Installation
 We’re going to use the official create-vite[https://vitejs.dev/] scaffolding tool to setup the project structure so make sure you have Node 12+ installed with NPM 6+. They also support Yarn and PNPM as package managers, but we’ll only cover NPM.
 
 Install Vite and initialise the project with:
"$ npm init vite@latest"
